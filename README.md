Collage of Dog Pictures

Here is an API I buit with .fetch.  Is is a common dog API that I decided to turn into a collage.  I have the code set to where the photos of dogs will appearr at 
random when the name of the do is selected.  Double tapping removes an image.  I am planning on adding an event listener that will display the name of the do when the photos is clicked on.
